We made an end to end application for online cab booking system under DBMS course.
We tried to implement the functionalities of such apps using
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP for our frontend
Django, mySQL for our backend.
The project is now under improvement phase which includes improving the security, UI and some other areas as well.


Taxi Management System
Overview
The Taxi Management System is a comprehensive project that integrates various DBMS concepts and technologies to facilitate efficient management of taxi services. The system ensures adherence to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, utilizes MySQL for database management, Django for backend development, and HTML/CSS for frontend interfaces. Key functionalities include transaction management, roll-up queries, and seamless user interaction.

Key Features
ACID Properties: Ensures reliable and secure data transactions by maintaining Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
Database Management: Utilizes MySQL database to store and manage taxi-related data such as drivers, vehicles, bookings, and payments.
Backend Development: Implements the backend logic and API endpoints using Django framework for robust and scalable application architecture.
Frontend Interface: Develops user-friendly interfaces using HTML and CSS for seamless interaction with the taxi management system.
Transaction Management: Implements transactional operations to maintain data integrity during complex operations such as booking, payment processing, and driver allocation.
Roll-Up Queries: Utilizes roll-up queries to generate insightful reports and analytics regarding taxi services, bookings, revenue, and customer preferences.
Technologies Used
MySQL: Database management system for efficient storage and retrieval of structured data.
SQL Workbench: Interactive SQL environment for database administration and query execution.
Django: High-level Python web framework for rapid development of secure and scalable web applications.
HTML/CSS: Frontend technologies for designing intuitive and responsive user interfaces.
Project Structure
/backend: Contains Django backend codebase including models, views, serializers, and API endpoints.
/frontend: Includes HTML/CSS files for frontend interfaces and user interaction components.
/database: Stores SQL scripts, schema designs, and data models for MySQL database management.
